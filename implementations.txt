1. 
when brining input to the canvas it starts with A - done 
then each new input i bring it goes up by 1 so B, C and accordingly -done
deleye input changes output changes 

2. 
in run mode the logic gate starts as false
as false it is grey 
as true it is red
and when each input is clicked it turns to true 

3. 
the rightcircle sends an outpit 
the left side takes an input 
input gives output only 
output takes input only 

4. 
can connect only input to output 
when input or output circle is clicked it is highlighted 
if input is clicked of one and and the output is clicked of two, input one and output two will connect and the the input one will disconnect from anything else it is connected to 

5. 
not take an input and gives an output it does the opposite of the input
so if input is true itll make it false
and vice versa


6. 
if clicked and drag the module moves as well as the connection it has to other modules 

7.
and logic gate 
takes two inputs 
and one output 

if both the inputs are true it results in true if even one is false it return false
outputs can connect to more than one input 

8. 
or logic gate basically takes two inputs and one output, if even one of the inputs true or both are true it will return true otherwise it both inputs are false it will return false
